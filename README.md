## Description of Project

This was the first project which participants of the Grow With Google (GWG) Scholorship program had to create.
The goal of this project was to create a memory game where you flip two cards at a given time. When two cards are flipped they do not match the cards show be flipped back to the hide position and when two cards match they are suppose to stay in the open position and light up as being green.

## Purpose of Project

GWG participants were challenged to use their new JavaScript skills which they learned. The project was designed to help students understand the process which creating an app or a game takes. Also this project helped to illustrate the need to prepare, plan and learn to trouble shoot.

## Instructions

How to play:

1. Click on any card to flip the card over to reveal the icon under it.
2. Once a card is flipped the timer will begin.
3. At any given time you are able to click on two cards to reveal the icon under those two cards.
4. When two cards match they will stay flipped and will light up as being green.
5. After you match all eight pairs the time will stop and you will see a summary box appear with your time and score.
6. At any given time if you want to reset the game you can click on the Reset button.
7. The summary box will give you an option to play again by clicking on that button or you can not play again by clicking on the cancel button.

## Additional Information

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
